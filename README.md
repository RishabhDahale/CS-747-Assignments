# Overview of the assignments
## Assignment 1
This assignment was to implement various stochastic bandit algorithms (epsilon-greedy, UCB, KL-UCB, Thompson Sampling). One interesting part of this assignment was to develop an algo for setting when we have some knowledge about the true means of the arms. Question was to develop algoeithm which will perform better than the thompson sampling when provided with a random combination of the true means of the arms. The idea and results of my algorithms can be found in the [report]{Assignment 1/report.pdf}

## Assignment 2
This assignment was to implement and compare the performance of various algorithms for getting the value functions of the MDP (Howard Policy Iteration, Linear programming formulation, and Value Iteration. The report of the performances can be found at [this link]{Assignment 2/report.pdf}

## Assignment 3
This was a more open ended problem. We to implement windy gridworld problem and its king's move version. Also we had to do the implementation for the stochastic king's move. The results can be found at [this link]{Assignment 2/report.pdf}
